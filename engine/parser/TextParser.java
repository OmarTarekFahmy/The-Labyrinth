/*
 * The TextParser Class is probably the most complicated class in the enire game
 * 
 * It takes the user's input and parses it into something that could be understood
 * and used by the program
 * 
 * The parser works by identifying an Action, an Object and an Indirect Object
 * 
 * Consider the following sentences:
 * 
 * "Open Mailbox"
 * Here the Action is Open and the Object is Mailbox
 * 
 * "Attack Spider with Sword"
 * Here the Action is Attack, the Object is Spider and the Indirect Object is Sword.
